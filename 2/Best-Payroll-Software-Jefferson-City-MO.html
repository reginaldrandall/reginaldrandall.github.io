Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow.
