All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory.

However, a POS purchase can happen anywhere with the increase in mobile payment terminals.

According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so. A Point Of Sale (POS) System is the combination of hardware and software that is used to sell stuff to customers, and organise the processes related to sales. The point of sale system is designed for delivery, carry-out or dine-in type restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>Advanced POS reporting notifies managers of employee or customer theft, shows menu and liquor sales trends over time, and analyzes customer data with built-in CRM. The basic function of a restaurant point of sale system is to facilitate customer orders and accept payment. That means you can make sales at trade shows, kiosks, special events and more - and that you can monitor sales and inventory from anywhere in the world, even when you can't be in the store in person.</p>
<p>The one thing they have in common is they're all deserving of being named one of the best restaurant POS systems on the market. The CLYO Systems cash register software makes it possible to manage the restaurant's floor plan and tables, build menus and display inventory in real time.
