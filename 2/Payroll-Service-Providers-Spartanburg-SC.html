For credit card processing, businesses can choose ShopKeep Payments or any processor in the BridgePay gateway including First Data, Chase Paymentech, Vantiv and Heartland. You also need magnetic stripe readers to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>APIs These connections are enabled by API-led connectivity , an integration approach that connects these systems through modern, managed APIs by exposing the underlying data. Toast allows for good inventory management in real-time, letting your bartenders make changes to the menu when they've run out of an item to mix a drink. IVend Retail is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as stock management with handheld devices and SMS integration.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for deeper insights into details like profits, labor costs, and historical comparisons, look for retail POS systems that offer advanced real-time reporting. The first one is an online type of system that is connected to a central computer for credit checking and inventory updating. This allows businesses to assess what products are being sold and what products are lagging in sales. For those wanting to do more with their business, Talech POS has great advanced features.</p>

<p>Menu, inventory and layout management are included in the basic restaurant software package, though add-ons are also available (more on that below). In some industries, mobile apps might replace some popular uses such as check-ins and product look-up or even ticket sales. Supports multiple payment options, improves staff management, and streamlines payroll and accounting procedures.

It's the tool you use to analyze and order your inventory, employees, customers, and sales. Nearly all retail operations in stores to day would be more time consuming and expensive to perform if it weren't for the power of a point of sale system.</p>
