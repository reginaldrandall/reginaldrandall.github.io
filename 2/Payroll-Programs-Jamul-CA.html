One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind.
