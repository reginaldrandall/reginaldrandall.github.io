<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not.
