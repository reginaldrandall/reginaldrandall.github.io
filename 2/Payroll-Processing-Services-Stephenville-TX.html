<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>
<p>With any of these restaurant management systems, a restaurant or any other food-serving establishment is sure to see a marked increase in its efficiency, productivity and in turn sales. And, with Retail Pro, you can collect and act on the data you need to drive more sales. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system. After you have generated the sales receipt, the customer sales order, work order or layaway is marked closed.</p>
<p>Such terminals are supported with various hardware components; cash registers, age verifiers, kitchen printers, barcode scanners, kitchen buzzers, and more.
