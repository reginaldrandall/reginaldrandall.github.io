<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow. Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store.

This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>

POS Nation is an all-in-one Point of Sale (POS) system built to the specific needs of restaurants, retailers, and specialty stores like pizzerias, tobacco shops, liquor stores, and specialty groceries.
