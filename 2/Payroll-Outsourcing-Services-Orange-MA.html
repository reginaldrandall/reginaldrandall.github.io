A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check.

<p>Cloud-based POS platform that lets restaurants facilitate workflow processes with inventory tracking, guest management and more. Data analytics are a dynamic part of modern POS systems. And while features like loyalty or marketing may not even be on your radar, you may find that implementing the tools that come with your chosen POS can significantly increase sales. Handheld scanners and wireless scanners have increased efficiency levels at point of sale to a large extent, and customers no longer have to queue up for many minutes while the cashier checks out their items one by one and comes up with the bill in a long and laborious process.</p>
<p>Whether they are standing at the bar or chilling on the terrasse, your customers want the full experience. Managing the various specials and happy hour promotions, as well as multiple menus in your business, should be easy and convenient.

Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>
<p>Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software. Most restaurant owners would agree that it's worth paying a little more each month in order to ensure that: 1) you and your staff can get support when you need it 2) you'll always have the most up-to-date software available. These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>

Connect with customers to drive repeat business by using accounts to track previous orders and by rewarding loyal regulars with discounts. You will know best what items you might need more than one of. Having staff carrying around iPads can make your business look more professional and save time with customer queries but there is, obviously, a cost premium per device.</p>
<p>Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. Your bar customer is paying the same amount as a customer in the restaurant.

Streamline data from all selling platforms into one location, allowing you to spend more time making business decisions that grow your business.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Though they are essential to handle day to day operation in a retail store or a restaurant, they do not help generating revenue directly. Point of sales software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that allow them to track the most popular products. The intuitive nature of LAVU's system makes it easy to learn and easy to train on, and the feature-rich iPad platform makes it easy to provide five-star customer service.</p>
