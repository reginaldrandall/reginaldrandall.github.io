<p>Point of sale (POS) can be referred to as a check-out or cash wrap and is usually the location in a store or restaurant where transactions for the exchange goods and services occur. Some point of sale vendors refer to their POS system as "retail management system" which is actually a more appropriate term given that this software is no longer just about processing sales but comes with many other capabilities such as inventory management, membership system, supplier record, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, hide barcode label creation, sale reporting and in some cases remote outlets networking or linkage, to name some major ones.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>Cloud-based POS systems allow you to access your sales from anywhere through any mobile devices. A standard Revel POS terminal includes an iPad, payment device, POS stand, router, Wi-Fi access point, POS printer and a secure cash drawer. With a streamlined interface that works for service staff and managers alike, Toast is a great choice for those who want a simple well-priced POS that does the job. Most POS solutions offer some form of inventory management.</p>
