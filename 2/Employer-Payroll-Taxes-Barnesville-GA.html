<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. Receive and adjust your inventory items each time you get more items in stock to keep your retail store's inventory levels, and your costs, accurate. They've found this provides an opportunity to focus on customers looking for specific product types and to influence their purchasing decisions earlier on in the sales process. A popular mobile, industry-leading point-of-sale system, Lavu POS has a design specific to restaurants and bars.</p>

<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
