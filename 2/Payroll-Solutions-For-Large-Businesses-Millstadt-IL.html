<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame. So, whether you're replacing your current POS system or buying a new one altogether, here's what you should consider as well as a bit of inspiration from fellow small businesses.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
