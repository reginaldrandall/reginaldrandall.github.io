<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Manages the inventory- The point of sale software maintains the business' inventory. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. It is a cost-effective restaurant billing software for small business , which is also user-friendly. A POS system's inventory management module must provide complete visibility and accountability at store level at all times. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, the name Square for Restaurants ” should tell you three things about this POS solution. IVend POS helps retailers reward customer value across all channels with integrated store and online loyalty, allowing shoppers to accrue and redeem points in any channel.

They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>
<p>All modern POS systems have a frontend interface for the point of sale and a backend (sometimes called ‘backoffice' or ‘dashboard') side for behind-the-scenes analytics and management functions. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this.

While the word inventory may instill fear in many managers, most admit, it directly affects a restaurant making money. Repeat customers are the lifeblood of any retail business.</p>
