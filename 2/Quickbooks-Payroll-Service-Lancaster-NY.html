<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>You can even drill down into reports to see more in-depth information such as a specific employee's productivity or the sales of a particular menu item If you already own multiple businesses or plan to expand in the future, this feature will prove invaluable to you as you look to manage and understand all of your various operations and how each is contributing to your bottom line.

But with plans that start at $69 per month, you get in-depth inventory, customer, and accounting management in a professional and impressive package.</p>
<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
