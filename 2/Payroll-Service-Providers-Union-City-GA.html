<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra.

At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
