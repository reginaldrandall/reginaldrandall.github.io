<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees.

This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered.
