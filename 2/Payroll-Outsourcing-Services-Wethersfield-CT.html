And with our custom-made software, you can make sure you offer your customers the best service and gain additional customer loyalty points. While some systems can handle the POS of both restaurants and retail businesses, many systems are designed specifically to handle the demanding needs of the latter.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind.

Optimize systems capabilities in general (file cleanup; knowing when to upgrade hardware and software).</p>
<p>Seating plans — The advantage of a POS system is that you can dynamically seat customers as tables become available.

For an all-in-one system for taking payments wherever your customers are, pair the Square POS and mPOS systems together to give your business an extra boost.</p>

A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>

In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order.</p>
<p>However, we believe this provider has the best restaurant point of sale software. Restaurants can process payments through Moneris, Cayan, Premier and Mercury, SmoothPay and PayPal. Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience.
