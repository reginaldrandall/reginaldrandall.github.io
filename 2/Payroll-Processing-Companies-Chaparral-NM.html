<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>

<p>The POS system makes it a good fit for new businesses or businesses with little to no point-of-sale experience. Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place.
