<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>Talech is perfect for restaurants and bars. Salespeople sometimes use it when they track inventory. When you log into the app, you'll notice that the overall interface is simple, intuitive and it provides smart but straightforward tools for managing customer information, generating sales reports, tracking inventory, optimizing staffing, as well as driving customer loyalty. It is easy to install and so simple to deploy that I'm embarrassed to brag about it. Truths when I say the features developed into the application are cutting edge and developed with the latest software methodologies.</p>
<p>Touch screen systems designed for restaurants, bars, cafes and anyplace that sales food to customers. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing.

<p>Larger restaurants and fine dining establishments may need things like multiple server stations, hostess station systems, bar server stations and several kitchen printers, but as a small restaurant you do not. Datio POS is an iPad POS system for retail stores, salons, small cafes, quick-service eateries and full-service restaurants. The cash only retail business is quickly fading into obscurity. Point of sale systems were made to help business owners make day-to-day tasks easier and faster.</p>

Or dive into the details with sales summaries and historical comparisons with more advanced, real-time reporting features.</p>
<p>Customers can purchase products online and pick them up at their preferred store outlets, they can order products not available in stores and have them shipped directly, and they can also return a product at the store or have it collected from the desired location, irrespective of the channel of purchase. Nowadays cash registers have become more sophisticated and they are used to process credit cards. Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards.</p>

Shopify POS ( see our review ) is used by over 150,000 businesses and has been around since 2013. Simply put, Point of Sale (POS) Systems allow business owners to increase their ability to reach their customers in terms of geography as well as assisting them to become more efficient marketers.</p>
<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>

Tight integration between the point of sale software and the cash drawer is a must. The Lightspeed restaurant EPOS also comes equipped with a high-tech restaurant management software which can be customised to your needs.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
