The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>

Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature.

<p>So, your staff at the restaurant, travel desk or any other POS outlet is always updated with the right information in real-time.
