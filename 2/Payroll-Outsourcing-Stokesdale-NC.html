If you choose a cloud-based restaurant POS system, you'll be able to make changes to your menu or pricing on the fly.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

A modern POS system will consist of a touchscreen computer that operates with POS software that's used to complete product orders and accept all payment types.</p>
<p>This software facilitates ordering, billing, reporting, accounting, table tracking, and receipt printing for restaurants and bars.

Most good Point of Sale systems have common functionality in the traditional areas of selling, printing receipts, handling customer accounts, managing discounting and reporting on sales.
