<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management.

<p>The great benefit of modern cloud-based systems is that reports are available to local or regional management in real time, which greatly enhances the quality of decision-making and future planning in areas such as stock and inventory, staff performance, branch comparison and margin control. Credit card reader: To be able to accept and process credit and debit card payments, you'll need the physical reader.</p>
<p>With Harbortouch Retail, take your retail business to the next level by utilizing the future of point of sale software and hardware technology with all the features you would expect in a retail solution. For retail stores, winning shoppers' loyalty is accomplished when their needs are met and their shopping experience leaves them satisfied that they received quality products at competitive prices and great customer service.</p>
<p>The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer. Square POS has become one of the most widely used point of sale systems out thereâ€”and for good reason.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system. Vape Shops: Although casual consumers tend to classify vape stores with tobacco shops, these two business types typically use different point of sale features.</p>

<p>A single POS terminal may be enough for small and new businesses, but you may want to add more if your business is busy and you need to reduce wait times. As your small business grows, so can your point of sales system. Track their hours, sales performance, overtime hours, and set special permissions for each user. It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software.</p>
<p>With today's modernized POS systems for bars, creating an engaging loyalty program that customers want to participate in is easy. You don't have to take our word for it though; here are some examples of happy Vend customers and what they have to say about our POS system.
