We enable digital transformation that connects our clients' operations from the back office to the front end and everything in between so they can delight customers anytime, anywhere and compete. For eligible ShopKeep customers, ShopKeep Capital is an easy, fast way to access funding that you can use to buy inventory, source new equipment, hire extra staff, and more.</p>

When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.</p>

You can take orders, manage tables and reservations, split checks, and accept payments with it. It manages inventory at the ingredient level, and its purchase-ordering system can automatically reorder supplies.</p>
