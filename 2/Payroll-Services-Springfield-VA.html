<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>POS systems still include both software and hardware components, but they now also offer many new functions as well. As the data are instantly available and input into your retail POS accounting back office software, you can now spot trends as they happen, not after they are long gone. Each day restaurants handle large volumes of cash and credit card transactions, making a POS system necessary. In this article, let's take a look at the ten best restaurant management software that are currently quite popular in the market.</p>
<p>Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice.

<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. Because hardware can be a significant expense, you may be reluctant to buy more than the bare minimum, but your restaurant will work more efficiently if you purchase enough hardware so employees aren't doubling up.

<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking.

The most important use of this system to a business owner is its ability to allow your business to process credit card payments.

Modern point-of-sale (POS) systems are no longer limited to cash registers due in part to new technologies such as the cloud and mobile devices. Allows business owners to create social media text alerts and sales coupons, creating an unprecedented opportunity to motivate and mobilize customers.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
