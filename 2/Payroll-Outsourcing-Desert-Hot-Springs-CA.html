<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>
<p>Mobility - mPOS allows you to be mobile” where you can accept orders and payments at a vendor show, or take orders on the floor of your restaurant or retail store. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

<p>Firstly, CAKE caters to full-service and quick-service restaurants, pubs, bars, and other food businesses. Credit and debit card transactions are now more common than cash payments POS systems make card processing fast, easy, and secure. A quick glance at a shopper's purchase history (or all those customer details you've started collecting!) in Retail Pro can equip your sales associates with the information they need to determine what products your customer would find most interesting and relevant, and make the offer for an upsell when they're in the store.</p>
<p>A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service. A POS system is computer software and hardware networked together to track sales and inventory as they occur. The user can experience better processing capability, enhanced communication, sophisticated consumer analytics, real-time inventory management, and wireless connectivity with mPOS smart devices.</p>

<p>With integrated credit card processing you are assured that the amount of the sale will match the amount charged on the credit card, eliminating the need to go back and match individual sales when the credit card batch does not match credit card sales. Although cloud-based software is easy to deploy and maintain for most bars, Ligan said it can be slow and prone to crash if you have an unstable internet connection.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers. Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe. A feature-rich POS software provides a huge range of capabilities such as billing and order processing, sales monitoring and reporting, inventory tracking, returns, analytics, mobile connectivity, customer data management, employee management, and loyalty programs.</p>

This cloud-based system has iOS and Android apps that allow you to access your sales data from anywhere. Point of sale systems allow for more effective and accurate transactions thereby decreasing the instances of customers' complaints about incorrect transactions. These systems are also responsible for keeping the bossiness data well-management and it is also ensured that no transaction is left unrecorded.</p>
<p>Keep all the stores linked up by sharing customers, gift cards, stock and more. You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>

POS terminal serves as the physical equipment that allows merchants to process payments to complete a customer purchase. These are the POS systems that are most recommended by fellow business owners for their usability.

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
