<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. QuickBooksPOS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as ring up sales and inventory tracking. The software helps you manage your inventory, customers, and staff, and it includes loyalty tools and a timeclock app. We know your business is all about repeat customers. TouchBistro's restaurant POS system features can accommodate small, mid-sized, and large restaurant businesses. PHP Point of Sale can be used by retailers, grocery stores, bakeries, coffee shops and museums.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>ShopKeep gives you the ability to view all of your stores on the dashboard and also offers a Pocket App which lets you check in on sales or inventory remotely.

This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
