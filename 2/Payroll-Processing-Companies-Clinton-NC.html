<p>The term point-of-sale is used to describe a variety of things. In fact, cash register in a retail store plays a vital role in keeping track of sales, inventory etc. Most point of sale companies offer retail POS system bundles that include essential hardware components in different variations. Restaurants with a healthy online customer base need a POS system like Clover, that can handle online orders and delivery management.

<p>You may think of point-of-sale (PoS) systems as just ordinary cash registers, but they're evolving to do much more. Order management: Process customer orders and generate bills digitally, making it easier to track sales and catch mistakes. Inventory management: Many POS systems help you keep track of your product inventory, allowing you to enter specific details about each item you sell and track your product receiving, sales, and shipping.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments).

Cloud-Based Systems : These are also referred to as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or web-based, cloud-based POS systems.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Also, you'll need all the features that a quality point of sale system provides to aid in managing your operations and growing your store's customer base.

It can be really challenging to create a comfortable ambience, meet the expectation of restaurant guests and also keep your staff happy and motivated at the same time.</p>
