<p>Learn what features to look for when choosing the best bar POS system for your business. IVend Retail presents a series of seven tightly integrated software modules that bridge your eCommerce and bricks-and-mortar presence to help you exceed your customer's great omnichannel expectations. Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival.

<p>There is usually a form of payment involved to complete the transaction, such as credit cards, cash, debit cards, EMV, and mobile payments.
