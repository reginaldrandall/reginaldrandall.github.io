<p>Most restaurants find that point of sale (pos) systems really are better for their work environment. A Point of Sale system enables cashiers to process transactions and serve customers efficiently, and allows managers to maintain tight control.

With POS software, restaurant managers and owners can meet many of their practical business needs, from managing daily service all the way up to high-level analytics.</p>

<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up.</p>
<p>The software provides inventory management to eliminate the need for manual stock tracking and management, which could cost you more hours doing mundane tasks than growing your revenue and customer base. You can analyze customer history data in Retail Pro to personalize your marketing with recommendations based on items they recently or frequently purchased. With many top-tier point of sale systems, your employees will be able to clock in and clock out through the POS.</p>
<p>This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrée or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction. A lot of big box stores have wildly expensive POS solutions, some of which were custom built for their needs.</p>
