<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Designed specifically for wine, beer, and liquor stores, this POS software has inventory and customer management tools, more than 70 reports, and a built-in timeclock. One of the newer restaurant POS on the market, Rezku weighs in heavy with an easy-to-use, modern and sleek interface. It is part of the Shopify ecommerce suite that lets you manage a business from everywhere, including tracking inventory across channels, accepting any form of payment, applying discounts, emailing customers their receipts, and processing refunds.</p>
<p>Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase. All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. POS systems increase security as employees are accountable for their orders, sales, and the drinks they pour. In 2015, EMV became the standard of credit card reader for its high security - making payment cards nearly impossible to copy and reduce the huge possibility of accepting counterfeit cards.</p>
