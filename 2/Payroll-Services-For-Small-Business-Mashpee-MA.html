<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong. We can help you with any type of point of sale pos software to satiate your needs. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success.</p>
<p>The accurate records of sales and inventory will help you determine which products are selling and which are not. POS systems have three parts: software, hardware and a credit card processor. A basic ‘starter' bundle will cost around £1,795 and includes the bar POS software along with a touchscreen PC, cash drawer, receipt printer, and card reader. Besides the great point of sale features, TouchBistro offers superb remote management and a strong reporting system.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>This online restaurant management system is all in one package for your business. For example, ShopKeep and TouchBistro build their systems around food and beverage businesses like quick-service restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions. The best bar point of sale system will also integrate tableside ordering and act as a mobile POS system.</p>
<p>Improved efficiency means higher customer satisfaction, lower costs and higher sales. Understand what items you should keep on your menu, how many sales come from your new promotions, how your new bartender performs, and more. But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment.

However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Inventory management, stock management, security, and timekeeping are only a few of the activities that this software can indeed simplify. With the roll-out of its Inventory 2.0 function, Lavu has addressed arguably its biggest deficit and its inventory management and purchasing ordering features are now on par with those of other top-rated systems.
