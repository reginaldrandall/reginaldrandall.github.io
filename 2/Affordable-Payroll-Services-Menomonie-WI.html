<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app. The cloud-based system was developed with scalability in mind and is suitable for all sized businesses across a range of industries, particularly hospitality, retail and services. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.</p>
<p>It has numerous SEO and marketing platform integrations so you can easily market your business and attract new customers. CRM databases also let retailers set up timed promotions (when a promotion is only valid for a given timeframe, after which the items on promotion revert back to their original pricing). Bring your in-store and online sales together with Shopify. For small businesses, trends like mobile payments and mobile loyalty programs are especially relevant to product selection.</p>
