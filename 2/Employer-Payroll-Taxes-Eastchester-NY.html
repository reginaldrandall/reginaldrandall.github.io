<p>Point of sale equipment is an essential tool required for the management of a business' day to day operations. Receive and adjust your inventory items each time you get more items in stock to keep your retail store's inventory levels, and your costs, accurate.

<p>It has numerous SEO and marketing platform integrations so you can easily market your business and attract new customers. CRM databases also let retailers set up timed promotions (when a promotion is only valid for a given timeframe, after which the items on promotion revert back to their original pricing). Bring your in-store and online sales together with Shopify. For small businesses, trends like mobile payments and mobile loyalty programs are especially relevant to product selection.</p>
