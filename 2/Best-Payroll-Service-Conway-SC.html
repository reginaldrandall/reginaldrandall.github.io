<p>Any retail store that wants to stay in business for a long time will appreciate every customer that walks through the front door; the question is whether or not they will choose to display that appreciation. At the same time updating between multiple stations and the back end administrative computer should be capable of being efficiently performed, so that on one hand either at the start of the day or at any time each station will have the latest inventory to process all items for sale, while on the other hand at the end of the day the back end administrative computer can be updated in terms of all sale records.</p>
