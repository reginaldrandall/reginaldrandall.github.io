<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>
