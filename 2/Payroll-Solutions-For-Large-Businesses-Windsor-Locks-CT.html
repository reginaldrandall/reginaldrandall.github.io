<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>Once you've examined your business requirements, it's time to start exploring which POS solutions can meet your needs.
