<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>They do, however, need to concern themselves with how much their bartenders are being tipped and how easy it is for customers to leave a gratuity, especially when completing transactions via a card or wallet app. The cloud-based system was developed with scalability in mind and is suitable for all sized businesses across a range of industries, particularly hospitality, retail and services. It may also need to be integrated with property management software.</p>
<p>Infor POS is a stable, secure, and scalable cloud-based POS solution for hotels, restaurants and other hospitality organizations. In this day and age, a POS system is a requirement for any business, not just restaurants. In addition to the TouchSuite Restaurant POS system, it resells Grubbrr kiosks and POS hardware for Clover, Talech, QuickBooks POS, and NCR Silver.

Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running.</p>
<p>Proactive retailers are constantly striving to increase visibility into exactly who their customers are, how they're interacting with your stores, and what they want. With the increase in complexity of data, retailers usually do not get time to maintain sales performance analysis, category analysis and inventories. Many POS systems are software suites that include sale, inventory, stock counting, vendor ordering, customer loyalty and reporting modules.</p>
