The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
