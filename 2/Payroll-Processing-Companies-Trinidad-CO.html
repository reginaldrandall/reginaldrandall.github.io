The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>This high-end system helps restaurants improve and grow their business. In addition to monthly software costs, the hardware costs are a one-time fixed cost that starts at $799. With its recipe management, you can set ingredients as you see fit and instantly see the effects of each change on the cost of your menu items. If you operate a business with multiple employees, your POS software can help you manage them even when you are not around.</p>

Choosing the right point of sale (POS) system is vital for small businesses. Plus, with constant staff turnaround in restaurants, an easy-to-use POS minimizes training time for getting new employees on the floor.

<p>Some are rather simple applications; others can manage complex inventory situations and employee time tracking. Now that you've eliminated the restaurant point of sale systems that don't meet your needs you can focus on the top three that have made the cut. Most new POS systems also store data in the cloud, giving you the convenience of accessing back office tools using an app or the browser on your phone or home computer when you're away from your business.</p>
<p>Such systems make quick customer assistance and remote inventory assessment for size, color etc. With an established means of sales control, your business growth can't outpace your ability as an owner to track profit levels against your financial obligations. You can visualize sales and get analytical reports and track inventory for effectively growing your business. But things can always go wrong, especially when you're dealing with back-office functions such as inventory or personnel management.</p>
<p>A merchant processing account is required to accept credit card payments from customers. In addition to Square's standard credit card processing capabilities, the restaurant POS system can also accept Google Pay and Apple Pay, even in the middle of an internet service outage. Management can identify best selling items with a product mix report and use digital ordering at the restaurant with a kiosk system. It's easy to keep track of your best customers and their favourite products with Storezigo's Restaurant POS customer database.</p>
