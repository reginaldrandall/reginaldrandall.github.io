<p>Most restaurants find that point of sale (pos) systems really are better for their work environment. A Point of Sale system enables cashiers to process transactions and serve customers efficiently, and allows managers to maintain tight control. The software integrates with QuickBooks Desktop financial software, ecommerce platforms, and other POS systems. Most POS software helps you stay aware of how your business is performing.
