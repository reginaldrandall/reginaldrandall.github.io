<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>
