<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up.</p>
<p>But it should be clear that the more extensive the restaurant service, the more advanced and varied the POS software must be to fully support all daily operations. With the eHopper POS all-in-one business management system, you can cut back time spent on daily operations and back office tasks and promote efficiency within your business. Stores can have a store server and the POS devices can be linked either to the store server or directly to iVend Enterprise over the Internet.</p>
<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
