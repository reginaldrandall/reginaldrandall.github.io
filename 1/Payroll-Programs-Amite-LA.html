That's because it's the software that lets you track sales, issue receipts, and perform back-office functions. The best bar point of sale system will also integrate tableside ordering and act as a mobile POS system.</p>
<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis.

You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
