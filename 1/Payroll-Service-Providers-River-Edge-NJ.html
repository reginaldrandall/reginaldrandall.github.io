<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>However, we believe this provider has the best restaurant point of sale software. Restaurants can process payments through Moneris, Cayan, Premier and Mercury, SmoothPay and PayPal. Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience. Hardware such as computers, monitors, and printers is often included in the purchase price of restaurant POS systems.</p>
