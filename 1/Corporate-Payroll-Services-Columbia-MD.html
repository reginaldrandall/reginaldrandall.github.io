<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals. Since 1990, we have aimed to give restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions, designed specifically for the industry.</p>
<h2>Top Payment Systems Around Columbia</h2>
<p>It cuts down on paperwork by automating the reconciliation of cash and card payments. TouchBistro is created with the foodservice business in mind, which is why it's among the most widely-used POS platforms by coffee shops, bars, fine dining, delis, restaurants, food trucks, and other similar shops. Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.</p>
<p>For example, it offers barcode scanners, employee management tools, sales tracking, and inventory management, at a basic or enterprise level. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options. The kitchen order token will help in better and easy management of a bar and restaurant. Celerant Technology enables retailers to deliver a great customer experience while optimizing back end operations through a powerful multi-channel retail solution.</p>

<p>Restaurant POS systems should also protect against any possible inside, employee theft. Modern POS systems for bars remedy this problem for bar owners by leveraging cloud technology to create always-accessible reports. The point of sale offers a tremendous opportunity to get to know your customers and to appeal to their consumer needs. You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>
<p>Since this is a cloud-based Point of Sales system, you can always check your inventory level and order new goods whether you are in the office, at home or on the go. You can control your inventory through streamlined reorder processes and easily transfer goods from one location to another. The POS software stores the information and maintains it within a database. There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely.</p>
<p>Retail Pro is the chosen software platform for omni-channel strategy by retailers in 130+ countries. Tailored retail POS system hardware bundles for your iPad and Mac or PC desktop workstations. With Square for Restaurants, for example, you get POS software that's geared specifically for restaurant use.

<p>It helps you manage restaurants, Mini Bar, Spa, Travel desk and many more. Square provides feedback through intelligent reports and analytics, giving you insights on your operations and a real-time situation on your sales, customers, and more. For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms.
