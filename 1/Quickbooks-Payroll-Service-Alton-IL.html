IVend Retail presents a series of seven tightly integrated software modules that bridge your eCommerce and bricks-and-mortar presence to help you exceed your customer's great omnichannel expectations. Accurate wait times reduce walk-away customers and no-shows and let diners check-in before arrival.

Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system.
