<p>There are EPoS systems which have been developed with the hospitality industry in mind. The cloud-based POS solution helps manage your stuff, serve customers accurately and in time, and monitor performance to depict trends and opportunities. With the diverse needs of different food establishments, no POS software is a fit-all solution. ShopKeep doesn't offer as many advanced features as Toast or Revel, but its raw ingredient tracking software and advanced employee permissions still places this POS system ahead of many of its competitors in these areas.</p>
<p>The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management. Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this. IoT-enabled POS systems will eliminate the need for retailers to manually keep track of inventory, reducing the losses arising from storing excess or inadequate inventory.</p>
<p>Its solutions include POS software, traditional POS hardware systems with touchscreen monitors, and mobile POS systems that use tablets. You have secure access to your data anywhere across multiple stores, and new features are always a free update away. And to top it off, Square for Restaurant comes with all the fundamental features you'd want from a restaurant POS system. With this plan you will receive inventory management for up to 1,000 products, sales analytics, the ability to send digital receipts, employee and customer management features, plus mobile connectivity and the ability to sell offline.</p>

<p>Small businesses will appreciate the savings from turning mobile devices into a POS without the need for extra hardware.

Since it is by default a free shop till system (not including card payment fees), all you do is sign up, download the app, possibly order the card reader, and start using the system.</p>
<p>With Cake POS, you have optional choices for hardware bundles and various software or service options. POS systems help different parts of your restaurant and bar communicate with each other.
