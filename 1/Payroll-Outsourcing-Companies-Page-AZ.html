<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>The POS system makes it a good fit for new businesses or businesses with little to no point-of-sale experience. Track your sales, inventory, employees and customers - everything you need to know in one place. Two robust sets of tools are offered - a free Square POS for credit card processing and tracking sales, and the Square for Retail with intelligent and integrated tools purpose-built for more complex retail businesses.</p>

<p>Credit card reader: Since the EMV payment standard went live in 2015 , secure and EMV-compliant credit card readers are a must-have. Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself. Mobile technology has untethered the payment process from the traditional register, turning the entire store into a POS via tablets and other devices.</p>

<p>It comes with a dynamic set of features that helps retail businesses of all types to succeed. Lightspeed has month-to-month and annual service contracts available, gives you a choice of credit card processors, and works with third-party POS equipment. One associated benefit for restaurant owners is the elimination of miscommunication between customers, servers, and kitchen staff; Orders can be sent straight from the customer to the kitchen, increasing efficiency and reducing mistakes.</p>
<p>APIs These connections are enabled by API-led connectivity , an integration approach that connects these systems through modern, managed APIs by exposing the underlying data.

<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory.

In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>ShopKeep is an elegant and easy-to-use iPad POS that can work great for smaller and midsize bars looking to keep things simple and inexpensive.

<p>Inventory Management: Having a POS system that specifically helps you manage your retail inventory can be a lifesaver Some of these features can include purchase order management, low stock alerts, and the ability to transfer stock across multiple stores to name a few. The POS unit handles the sales to the consumer but it is only one part of the entire POS system used in a retail business. The restaurants can generate 15 to 20 bills in a minute's time, ensuring quicker settlements.</p>
<p>Although Vend is our choice as the best retail POS system, it is important to research other POS systems for yourself to see what system is the best option for your business. Silverware is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as cloud-based solutions and real time web-based reporting.

<p>If the sound POS system is connected to the computerized accounting system, then the user can clear credit cards, record transactions manage sales, and collect taxes quickly. On the high end, if you're investing in hardware and software to be used with multiple terminals, you'll need to consider the cost of licensing the product per terminal (upwards of $800-$1200 for a non-Cloud system), the cost of each terminal's credit card software (perhaps another $300-$500 each), and, if you don't have the terminals already, between $2,000-$3,000 per terminal.</p>
<p>While considered a Point of Sale system, Lightspeed Restaurant POS is much more. We only sell ruggedized POS hardware designed to meet the strenuous demands of busy restaurants.
