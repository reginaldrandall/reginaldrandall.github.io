<p>It can be challenging to find the right Point of Sale software system for your business. Indeed, these systems are often well suited for small businesses because they are the least expensive of the POS system options, they nonetheless provide many helpful features, including automatic sales and tax calculation ability; calculation of change owed to the customer; sales report generation capability; capacity to sort food stamps and trading stamps (through programming of function keys); and scanning.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
