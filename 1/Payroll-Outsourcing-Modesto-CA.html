<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place. With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>You may be able to use all or most of your existing hardware when you add Lightspeed to your business—speak to your sales rep for more information.

Every business is unique, and TallySales Retail Management Systems allows you to run your business your way.</p>
