<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow.

<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.
