<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>However, customers tend to abandon their cards if the balances get below a certain amount. Built with advanced inventory features, in-house marketing capabilities, and the ability to integrate with virtually any payment processor, talech takes your standard POS to the next level. Some point of sale systems only accept online payments. By using an API-led approach to connectivity, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to integrate their POS system to not one, but three systems--creating a unique solution that provides their restaurant chains with unprecedented visibility into their beer inventory.</p>

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?"
