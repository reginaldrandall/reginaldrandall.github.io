<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS).
