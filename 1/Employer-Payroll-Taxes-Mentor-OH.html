<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactionsâ€”information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>With the right software you would be able to simplify managing aspects, automate tedious tasks and finally efficiency and speed in customer services, which would result in a better business and increase your profits. Luckily, restaurant POS software makes it easy to create an online ordering portal with minimal effort on your part. From efficient table-side ordering and employee management to reporting and accounting, our POS system for restaurants offers all the tools you need to run a successful operation, whether you own a single location or many.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.
