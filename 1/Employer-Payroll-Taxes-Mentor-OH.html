<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>With the right software you would be able to simplify managing aspects, automate tedious tasks and finally efficiency and speed in customer services, which would result in a better business and increase your profits. Luckily, restaurant POS software makes it easy to create an online ordering portal with minimal effort on your part. From efficient table-side ordering and employee management to reporting and accounting, our POS system for restaurants offers all the tools you need to run a successful operation, whether you own a single location or many.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis.
