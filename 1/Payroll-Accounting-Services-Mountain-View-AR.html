<p>When choosing a retail store for shopping needs, shoppers choose where to go based on a number of factors. Nowadays POS systems are also used in goods and property leasing businesses, equipment repair shops, healthcare management, ticketing offices such as cinemas and sports facilities and many other operations where capabilities such as the following are required: processing monetary transactions, allocation and scheduling of facilities, keeping record and scheduling services rendered to customers, tracking of goods and processes (repair or manufacture), invoicing and tracking of debts and outstanding payments.</p>

Its design team, which is made up of former waiters, bartenders and restaurant managers, has tweaked the system based on workers' needs. Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software.</p>
<p>The Revel POS is designed to be a full restaurant POS system, managing finance and accounting in addition to sales, inventory, and staff. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order.</p>
<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
