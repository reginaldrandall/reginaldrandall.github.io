<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>Mobility - mPOS allows you to be mobile” where you can accept orders and payments at a vendor show, or take orders on the floor of your restaurant or retail store. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

In business, the customer data is helpful for advertising as it offers insights regarding which customer would be paying attention in the sale.</p>
<p>The retailers can bring incentives, cross-sell, interact with shoppers, and up-sell by swiping a loyalty card. Denali, the on-premises accounting system from Cougar Mountain Software, can be used by businesses of all sizes, including those with multiple locations. When you've got the basics of good inventory management and great customer service in place, you can devote mental energy to creating an immersive, interactive experience in your stores.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It's very likely that Vend will play nice with the printers, scanners, credit card readers, and POS equipment you already have. It can also mean that the system—software and cloud server—must be capable of generating reports such as analytics of sale against inventory for both a single and multiple outlets that are interlinked for administration by the headquarters of the business operation. Bar and nightclub management software that has a built-in customer relationship management (CRM) system enables you to collect guests' contact information and detailed order history any time customers pay with a debit or credit card.</p>

By using CAKE's employee management and basic timecards, you can clock in employees, track their breaks, and monitor overtime.
