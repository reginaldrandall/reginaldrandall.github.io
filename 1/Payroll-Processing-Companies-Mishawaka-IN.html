<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>The Offline Mode will not let you process integrated payments, edit & remove current customer profiles, or to discard and park sales. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. We do custom Point of Sale software development and pin pad interfaces compatible with all third-party devices for intuitive, feature-rich payment systems and terminal appli development systems improve workflows and customer experiences with a wide selection of sought-after features, including security algorithms, customer engagement modules, and analytics engines, and much more.</p>

Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions.
