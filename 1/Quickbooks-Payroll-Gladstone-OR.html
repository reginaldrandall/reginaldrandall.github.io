<p>This feature has been around since I started in the cash register business some 25+ years ago. Integration of other aspects of the business with the bar POS system : It will entail a lot less hassle if the management of the bar and the patrons can be integrated with the other aspects of maintaining a business. Before diving into why a retail POS is not ideal for a restaurant, let's take a step back a first talk about what a point of sale is and why you should use one in the first place. With Instore, you can take orders and accept payments from anywhere in your store, manage your menu or product catalog, analyze sales data, track inventory, issue gift cards, and customize receipts with coupons and special offers.</p>
<p>Reward your best customers with a loyalty program tracked in your POS system. If you want control over your profit and loss, you need to start with a good inventory management function.

Businesses can access the software via the internet, or though iPad or iPhone apps.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>
