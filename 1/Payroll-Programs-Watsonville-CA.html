<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Point of sale software modules easily allow credit card processing and are built to easily receive input from credit card swipers. Reducing the time it takes to get your customer's their food is critical and can even make up for less quality.

<p>For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel. The speed at which point of sale (POS) software is evolving is significant. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds.

<p>Hardware â€” Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers.

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today.
