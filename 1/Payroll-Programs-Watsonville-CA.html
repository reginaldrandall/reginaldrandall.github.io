<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Point of sale software modules easily allow credit card processing and are built to easily receive input from credit card swipers. Reducing the time it takes to get your customer's their food is critical and can even make up for less quality. Sales are the most important part of any business and so they come from customers, so POS systems should streamline the customer experience to make it as hassle free and pleasant as possible.</p>

After you have generated the sales receipt, the customer sales order, work order or layaway is marked closed.</p>
<p>For example, department stores often have POSs for individual product groups, such as appliances, electronics, and apparel. The speed at which point of sale (POS) software is evolving is significant. If you need internal security, manage data access with employee passcodes for checking individual sales and refunds. When choosing the best POS system for your bar, it is important to factor in the features you need and your available budget.</p>

Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch. Retailers with a lot of inventory need a barcode scanner to help them manage, stock, and speed up their checkout process. POS hold all the tracks for customers and their respective orders with an eye on business loyalty programs, which in return results in better shopper experience.</p>

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management.
