<p>Selecting the best retail point of sale (POS) system is not something to take lightly. Hardware: This includes routers, terminals, kiosks, handheld devices, card readers, kitchen display systems, printers, and guest-facing display. Our projects range from single-purpose tasks for small businesses to highly complex, multi-platform systems for large corporate clients. Provides an invaluable tool that allows you to not only process purchases but integrates inventory, customer info, returns, exchanges, credit card processing, rewards programs, sales, records, etc all on one machine.</p>
<p>As a smaller restaurant, don't feel duped into buying the more complex POS systems. While POS software features that help streamline operations are essential, both hardware and software should be designed with efficiency, effectiveness, and ease-of-use in mind. If you are a retail business that needs more than just a light-weight cloud POS system, POSIM is right for you. Systems such as Square Point of Sale are known for offering small dongles that connect to a tablet and let you swipe credit cards on the go. While you may not immediately need this type of mobility, it is good to know that it's available.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>

Its use is no longer restricted to the retail stores in developed countries or multi national retail stores.

Waiterio is an affordable and easy-to-use Point of Sale (POS). Some restaurant POS systems will even contain features to facilitate creating an online menu and delivery service that can be embedded into a website.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well. Simply explained, every time your customer purchases your business, they're completing a point of the sale transaction.</p>
