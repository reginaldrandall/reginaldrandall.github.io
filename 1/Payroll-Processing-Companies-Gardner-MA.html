Point of sale software modules easily allow credit card processing and are built to easily receive input from credit card swipers. Reducing the time it takes to get your customer's their food is critical and can even make up for less quality. Sales are the most important part of any business and so they come from customers, so POS systems should streamline the customer experience to make it as hassle free and pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>Many times the systems were confusing, and this meant increased hours spent training staff members on the functionality of the systems. Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed.
