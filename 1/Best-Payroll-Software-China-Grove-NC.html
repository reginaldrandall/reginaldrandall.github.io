<p>The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Likewise, Clover features other restaurant management tools for inventory management, real-time reporting, loyalty programs, staff management, and accounting.
