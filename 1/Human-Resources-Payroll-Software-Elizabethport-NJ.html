<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>
<p>Today, smartphones, cloud computing, and RFID technology enable even the smallest businesses to become point-of-sale (POS) wizards. Regardless whether taking orders over the phone or in person, the pizza POS software should guide the staff from greeting the customer through detailed order recording, through any up sells, and to the payment information, and finally the order fulfillment. The buyers guide to POS (Point of Sale) software provides in-depth information to the business people and can help them in choosing the appropriate point of sale system for their industry.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps.
