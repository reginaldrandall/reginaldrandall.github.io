<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement. POS software records each sale when it happens, so your inventory records are always up-to-date.</p>

As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package.

<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window.

<p>Businesses that experience the most success with their point-of-sale systems are ones who have a great POS company supporting them. As evident as the benefits of a POS system are, we found that 56 percent of single-store retailers are still not using one Instead, we found, many are still using a combination of manual methods, cash registers, QuickBooks and Excel for bookkeeping.
