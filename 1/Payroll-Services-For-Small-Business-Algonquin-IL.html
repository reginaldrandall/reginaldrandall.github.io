Its design team, which is made up of former waiters, bartenders and restaurant managers, has tweaked the system based on workers' needs. Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software.</p>
<p>Other functions of a POS system are to maintain sales information for reporting purposes as well as customer information for receivables management, marketing and specific buying analysis. The automation saved a retailer many hours in determining which departments contained the best selling items and how many sales dollars were generated. While ringing up customer purchases, the system makes it easy for the bartender to add a gratuity, split tabs evenly or separate checks whenever required to.</p>
