<p>A point-of-sale system gives you the ability to accept whatever form of payment your customers prefer. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory. Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. The software comes with a powerful API, a key tool that offers retailers the freedom to integrate existing systems to achieve centralized management. The vital purpose of any such system is to keep the business data organized, well-managed and maximize profit and the POS knowledge will help your staff to work efficiently and enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

An effective inventory management system combined with secure storage and lock-up procedures will result in far less loss due to employee theft.
