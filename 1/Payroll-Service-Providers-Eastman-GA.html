<p>The point is to start with a checklist for evaluating restaurant POS systems. You must know that the eatery point-of-sale system software needs to be very efficient so that you can deal with long queues of customers. Integrated inventory and employee management, customer loyalty programs, and multi-store management all require purchasing the more expensive plans. Its table mapping function, for instance, provides a simple, neat and organized restaurant layout management interface.</p>
