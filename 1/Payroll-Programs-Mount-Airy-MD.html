Since 1990, we have aimed to give restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions, designed specifically for the industry.</p>

<p>But retailers like you are creative, visionary people with many idea of how to improve your in-store experience.

You will know best what items you might need more than one of. Having staff carrying around iPads can make your business look more professional and save time with customer queries but there is, obviously, a cost premium per device.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>

While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
