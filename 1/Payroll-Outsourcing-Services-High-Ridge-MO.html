Some retailers choose to operate an RMS by assembling the various pieces from different software vendors: a POS system from Vendor A, an inventory management system from Vendor B, purchasing management from Vendor C, a business intelligence tool from Vendor D, an ecommerce system from Vendor E and so on.
