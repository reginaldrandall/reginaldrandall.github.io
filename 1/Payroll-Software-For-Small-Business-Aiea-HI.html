<p>Point of sales systems (also known as POS) are employed in retail stores, medicine counters, restaurants, hotels, clinics and basically any kinds of shops and stores across the world. In addition to POS services, Habortouch also offers access to online reservations, employee management systems, and a customer database. But when you are dealing with back-office functions like personnel management or inventory, things can sometimes go wrong. We can help you with any type of point of sale pos software to satiate your needs. The payment options offered, the speed of the transaction, and the ability to tailor the transaction to the customers' needs each have profound impacts on customer satisfaction and your overall business success.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>
