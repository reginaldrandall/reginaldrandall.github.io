<p>Point of sale (POS) is a technology for financial transactions at retail establishments, for example, at a supermarket. Pairing 100% compatible hardware options with your software minimizes setup time. Most POS systems are able to be plugged in to the business' high speed internet connection. Whether you own a small boutique with a handful of SKUs or a variety store with thousands of products, one thing is for sure; if you don't have the right inventory balance, you're missing out on sales and killing your cash flow. Inventory Management: Save your time and money while updating inventories.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu.

ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer. It also has a built-in timeclock and sales reports that show your most popular items, busiest hours, and top employees.</p>

<p>The less time you need to spend on accounting and calculating your operational costs, the more time you have for greeting customers and improving your bar business in other areas.

If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal.
