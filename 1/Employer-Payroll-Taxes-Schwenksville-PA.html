For retailers, only Cumulus Retail offers a simple solution with the power to scale to a national enterprise network of stores over time. And while the software half of the POS system equation is probably most important, especially in a cloud-based solution, many retail businesses will still require a hardware half.</p>
<p>Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software. Because hardware can be a significant expense, you may be reluctant to buy more than the bare minimum, but your restaurant will work more efficiently if you purchase enough hardware so employees aren't doubling up. Most online businesses use a digital system to track sales.</p>
