<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from.

<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need.
