<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table.

Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
