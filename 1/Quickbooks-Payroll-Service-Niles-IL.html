<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>This cloud-based POS platform is suitable for medium-sized and large businesses in the restaurant and hotel industry. Use your POS system to provide you with both sales and customer information using analytic charts and reports. Lightspeed's inventory system makes it easy for you to save time with centralized purchasing catalogs that are integrated into the POS software. The free product features a robust package with strong inventory and employee management that's particularly good for smaller restaurants and retail shops.</p>

Simplify your accounting process, build demand conscious rosters, generate online orders, and drive sales through loyalty programs with hospitality's most integrated point of sale.

But with plans that start at $69 per month, you get in-depth inventory, customer, and accounting management in a professional and impressive package.</p>
<p>Aside from the POS system, it features customizable menu management.

While all point of sale systems provide small business owners with sales data to some degree, there can be considerable variation in how that data is presented and how easy it is to access.</p>
