NCR Silver uses the normal POS tablet layout with user buttons on the right and open sales on the left. Thrive POS provides a comprehensive suite of restaurant business solutions designed to increase top-line sales and decrease costs. In a restaurant, it's necessary to have reliable, durable POS hardware. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management. Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this. IoT-enabled POS systems will eliminate the need for retailers to manually keep track of inventory, reducing the losses arising from storing excess or inadequate inventory.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
