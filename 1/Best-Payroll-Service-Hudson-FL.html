<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>The advantage to businesses that provide a unified commerce experience to their customers is that omnichannel customers spend more than single-channel customers. Many POS systems allow you to customize your receipts with your business's logo or to go paperless by sending a digital receipt or giving the option for no receipt. As well as being able to track customer purchases over time, Booker allows you to connect your POS with customer profiles to process payments using a card on file for incredible fast and efficient transactions.</p>

<p>Along with the paperless system, you can track your restaurant's sales performance with real-time analytics. Cloud-based point of sale enables you to lower upfront capital expenditure on software and hardware. Global Payments, one of the biggest credit card processors in the world, says unattended retail is the future of POS systems and predicts that it will become a $13 billion industry over the next five years.</p>
<p>Shifting to a mobile POS system and eliminating the fixed POS station yields some benefits for bar businesses. Improves inventory management, a crucial component of a busy deli. Search small business POS systems online, and you'll find yourself in the middle of a battle over the latest product of the week because they're hundreds, if not thousands. Reports show a complete picture of restaurant operations and life cycles: menu consumption, reservation frequency, hours of high restaurant load, busiest tables, most active employees, payment methods, and automatic tax calculations.</p>

<p>Among the most common inventory management features available in POS software are reminders to inform you when stock of a certain product is running low. Vend is mobile, so you can take your point of sale system onto the shop floor, beat the queues and build personal engagement with your customers. POS once referred only to the site—typically, a counter with a cash register where customers handed over cash for goods and services.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
