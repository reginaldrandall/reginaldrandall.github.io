<p>Small and mid-size business owners need a Retail POS platform that is capable of managing payment transactions, inventory and purchasing management, pricing, sales and product promotions for single and multi-store locations. Cloud-based POS systems are also created to be compatible with a wide range of POS hardware and sometimes tablets such as Apple's iPad Thus cloud-based POS also helped expand POS systems to mobile devices , such as tablet computers or smartphones 12 These devices can also act as barcode reader s using a built-in camera and as payment terminal s using built-in NFC technology or an external payment card reader.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>You mention how a point of sale is the most important place for customers to visit since it is the place the customer can go.
