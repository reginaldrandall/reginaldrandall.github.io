<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. NCR Silver uses the normal POS tablet layout with user buttons on the right and open sales on the left. Thrive POS provides a comprehensive suite of restaurant business solutions designed to increase top-line sales and decrease costs. In a restaurant, it's necessary to have reliable, durable POS hardware. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers.
